I am a computer science student, solution designer and deverloper, as well as a tech enthousiast and art lover! I am located in [Aix-en-Provence](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Aix-en-Provence#map=12/43.5361/5.3879) 🇫🇷🎨⛰️. I want to collaborate more on various projects and hope to contribute to open source.

- ⚙️ I work mainly with `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.java`. But what I enjoy the most is `.go` and `.rust`!
- ❤️ I love Open Source, learning and traveling (when I can spare the time to do so).
- ⚡ Fun fact about me: I'm a big card game guy, in the keyboard hobby and also gundam builder (gunpla).
- 🌱 I am currently learning more about design and project management, as well as expanding my DevOps skills 👩‍💻
